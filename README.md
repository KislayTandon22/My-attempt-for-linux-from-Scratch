## Theory
#### Root
Root is the superuser account in Unix and Linux. It is a user account for administrative purposes, and typically has the highest access rights on the system.
### Super user
In Linux and Unix-like systems, the superuser account, called 'root', is virtually omnipotent, with unrestricted access to all commands, files, directories, and resources.
